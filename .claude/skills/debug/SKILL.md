# /debug — Investigate and Fix a Bug

LOGS FIRST. Always. No exceptions. No hypothesizing before reading logs.

## Level 1: Local

1. Read logs / error output.
2. Check recent commits (`git log --oneline -10`).
3. Follow: error message → most likely location. No circular searching.
4. Isolate the cause.
5. Fix, write test, verify.

## Level 2: Expanded (if L1 fails)

1. Search Eichi-Shinkofa KB for known patterns.
2. Web research in 7 languages (EN, FR, ZH, JA, KO, DE, RU).
3. Try fix, verify with tests.

## Level 3: Escalation to Jay (if L2 fails)

1. **STOP.** Do not keep trying.
2. Generate detailed report: what failed, what was tried, what was searched, what sources were consulted.
3. Present options to Jay for brainstorming.
4. Jay decides direction.

## Rules

- Context Reset: After 2 failed corrections on same issue → `/clear` or new conversation.
- Gate 7 applies: every diagnostic verified via external source, not assumption.
- Never present uncertainty as fact. If unsure, say so.

See `mnk/05-Workflows.md` WF-05 for full details.
