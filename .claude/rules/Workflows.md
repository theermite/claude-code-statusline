# Workflows — Behavioral Rules & Platform Standards

## Automatic Quality Protocol (BLOCKING — applies to ALL code, not just /dev)

Every time code is written or modified — whether via `/dev`, a simple request, or a bug fix — the quality protocol applies **automatically**. Jay should never have to ask for it. `/dev` adds ceremony (agent orchestration, formal Blueprint scoring); the protocol below is the **floor**, always active.

> "Chaque brique est parfaitement posée et vérifiée. C'est ce qui permet de créer un mur parfait. Chaque mur parfait crée un édifice parfait. Un édifice parfait offre une expérience qualitative et fluide à l'utilisateur, au point qu'il ne se rende pas compte du travail fourni pour en arriver là."

### The 8 Automatic Gates

| # | Gate | What | When |
|---|------|------|------|
| 1 | **Context** | Check Blueprint/CDC if they exist. If neither exists → propose a plan before coding. | Before first line of code |
| 2 | **Reformulate** | State what you understood, what you'll do, what you won't touch, files impacted. Wait for validation on non-trivial changes. | Before first line of code |
| 3 | **TDG** | Write tests FIRST. They must fail (red) before implementation. | Before implementation |
| 4 | **Code** | Implement. Atomic commits. Backup tag every 3-4 commits. | Implementation |
| 5 | **Lint** | Zero lint errors. Run linter after changes. | After code |
| 6 | **Tests** | All tests pass — unit + integration + anti-regression. No "it should work." | After code |
| 7 | **Security** | No secrets, no injection, no weak patterns. Hooks catch most; verify the rest. | After code |
| 8 | **Verify** | Prove it works. Evidence over assertion. On UI: run dev server and test in browser. | Before reporting done |

**`/dev` adds** (on top of the 8 gates): 3-Layer strategic check, Eichi/veille research, non-tech PREPARE agents, i18n/visibility/SEO, non-tech VALIDATE agents, formal Blueprint/CDC/PET update, Obsidian sync.

**The 8 gates are non-negotiable and automatic. Jay never needs to invoke them.**

## Behavioral Rules

- **Reformulate before coding (BLOCKING)** — when >2 files impacted, architecture change, or ambiguous request: state (1) what you understood, (2) what you will do, (3) what you won't touch, (4) files impacted. Wait for Jay's validation. Single-file obvious changes: brief confirmation suffices.
- **Deduce before asking** — check git history, logs, and code first. Ask Jay only what cannot be found.
- **Follow the trace** — recent commits → error message → most likely location. Direct path, no circling.
- **Context reset** — after 2 failed corrections on same issue → `/clear` or new conversation.
- **Writer/Reviewer** — for critical code, use two separate sessions (write + review).
- **Flag uncertainty explicitly** — say "I'm not certain" when unsure. Uncertainty acknowledged is trusted; uncertainty hidden erodes trust.
- **Scope** — state what you will/won't touch. Inform Jay if scope changes.
- **Consult Eichi first** — Eichi-Shinkofa KB is our collective brain. Search it for ALL domains (vision, coaching, tech, marketing, gaming, neurodiversity) before web research, before any decision.
- **Verify before claiming** — training data is months stale. Check Eichi + web for versions, features, best practices, architecture patterns before any recommendation that influences a decision.
- **3 Layers filter** — every decision passes: L3 (Shinkofa vision respected?) → L2 (serves visibility/revenue?) → L1 (doable now?). See `rules/Strategic-Context.md`.
- **Research in 7 languages** — EN, FR, ZH, JA, KO, DE, RU for thorough coverage.
- **Visibility-first** — everything is potentially sellable. SEO, GEO, copywriting from day one.
- **Fix pre-existing errors** — if tests fail at session start, fix them. They are your responsibility.
- **Write session reports** — mandatory after every session. Stored in `docs/Sessions/`.
- **Detect environment** — OS, machine (local/VPS), paths, shell at session start.
- **Atomic commits** — one logical change per commit. Hook-enforced.
- **Lego Library First (BLOCKING)** — before coding ANY UI element, check `@shinkofa/ui` inventory in `rules/Quality.md`. If it exists → import. If not → code in `Shinkofa-Shared/packages/ui/` first (with tests + story), then import. All text via `@shinkofa/i18n` keys (FR/EN/ES). All shared types via `@shinkofa/types`.
- **Anti-overengineering** — only make changes directly requested or clearly necessary. No extras, no abstractions for one-time ops, no hypothetical futures. Three similar lines > premature abstraction.
- **ZERO rm -rf on work directories (BLOCKING)** — NEVER `rm -rf` on dist/, build/, output/, data/, or any directory containing work. `rm -rf` bypasses the recycle bin = IRREVERSIBLE LOSS. Always `mv x x-backup` or ask Jay BEFORE deletion.
- **Sync Obsidian project notes (BLOCKING)** — **3 files, not 21.** At session start: load `_Cross-Project.md` + `_Index.md` + current project file. Additional files on demand only. At session end: write only to files touched by the session (current project + `_Cross-Project.md` if cross-project decisions + `Contenu.md` if visibility candidates). If MCP unreachable: STOP and escalate.

## Non-Tech Agents: BEFORE and AFTER (NOT During)

```
PREPARE PHASE (non-tech agents: UX, Brand, Pedagogy, Gaming, Content)
  → Framework choice, UX patterns, copy, i18n decisions
  → Output: validated technical decisions
     ↓
BUILD PHASE (tech agents only)
  → TDG → Code → Lint → Tests → Atomic commits
     ↓
VALIDATE PHASE (non-tech + tech agents)
  → Blueprint scoring, CDC alignment, UX review
  → Verify security doesn't block features
```

## Context Engineering

### Compaction
Long conversations trigger automatic context compaction (compression). PreCompact and PostCompact hooks (in settings.json) handle state preservation and recovery. Takumi saves task state before compaction and restores it after.

### Prompt Caching
1-hour cache TTL enabled globally (`ENABLE_PROMPT_CACHING_1H`). Pauses up to 1h keep the full context warm. Beyond 1h, context is reloaded from scratch — normal and expected.

### Agent Concurrency
Max 4 sub-agents running simultaneously. More dilutes quality and risks context overflow. If a task needs >4 agents, sequence them in batches.

### Context Reset
After 2 failed corrections on the same issue → `/clear` or new conversation. Degraded context causes circular failures.

## Debug Escalation (3 levels)

| Level | Trigger | Action |
|-------|---------|--------|
| L1 | First attempt | LOGS FIRST. Recent commits → error → most likely location. |
| L2 | L1 failed | Eichi consult + web research (7 languages). |
| L3 | L2 failed | **STOP.** Generate detailed report. Return to Jay for brainstorming. |

## Post-Block Recovery Protocol (BLOCKING)

After ANY block (hook, system rule, tool refusal): **(1)** parse the full block message → **(2)** identify exact cause → **(3)** adapt → **(4)** retry once → **(5)** escalate with cause + alternative + question → **(6)** NEVER stay passive, NEVER deliver degraded silently. Violation = `-20` session score.

## PR Upstream Review Gate (BLOCKING)

> Before submitting ANY pull request to an external/upstream repo (not our own), ALL checks below must pass. Added 2026-04-03 after 3 PRs submitted to The-Vibe-Company/companion with avoidable errors.

| Check | What | Why |
|-------|------|-----|
| **Import resolution** | Every import/require in changed files must resolve against the TARGET repo, not our fork | 2 test files imported modules that only existed in our fork |
| **Mock-call parity** | For every mock in tests, count the actual calls in source — mocks must match exactly | A 3-mock setup for a 2-call function shifted all assertions |
| **Security self-review** | On security code: check OWASP basics (spoofing, bypass, injection) | Rate limiter trusted X-Forwarded-For blindly |
| **Clean fork check** | No fork-specific code (features, routes, configs) leaks into upstream PR | Multi-node code leaked into upstream tests |
| **CI dry-run** | Run the target repo's test suite locally before pushing | Would have caught all 3 issues |

Violation of this gate is BLOCKING.

## Platform Minimums

| Platform | Non-negotiable |
|----------|---------------|
| Web | Mobile-first 375px+, WCAG 2.2 AA, dark/light/high-contrast, reduced-motion, Core Web Vitals, FR/EN/ES, ND-friendly |
| Desktop | Dark/light themes, keyboard shortcuts, responsive resize, non-blocking UI |
| Mobile | Touch 44x44px, offline-first, <200KB initial, TTI <3s on 3G |
| CLI | `--help`, exit codes, JSON output, `--no-color` |
| Content | Factual, Jay's voice, GDPR-compliant, no raw AI published |

## Pre-RAG Audit (BLOCKING)

Any (re)indexation of a knowledge base toward a RAG must be preceded by `/pre-rag-audit`. CRITICAL findings must be resolved. WARNINGS must be documented. Violation = RAG poisoning = `-10` session score. Run at minimum every 30 days on Eichi-Shinkofa KB.

## Code Registry

Run `/update-registry` after adding, removing, or renaming classes/functions. The skill generates `docs/registry/` (created on first run). CI can verify: `git diff --exit-code docs/registry/`. For `@shinkofa/*` packages, registry progressively replaces the manual inventory in `rules/Quality.md`.

## Marketing Automation Gate (BLOCKING on public platforms)

Every public-facing feature ships with its visibility pipeline. Building the tool without building the distribution is building in a vacuum.

| Gate | What | When |
|------|------|------|
| SEO/GEO | Meta tags, structured data, Open Graph, AI-optimized content | Before deploy |
| Auto-publish | Content pipeline connected (blog → LinkedIn/Discord/Telegram minimum) | Before launch |
| Analytics | Privacy-first tracking active (no PII, cookie-consented) | Before launch |
| Capture | Email capture or CTA present on public pages | Before launch |

This is not about marketing as a task — it is about marketing as infrastructure. Build the pipes now, so content flows forever. A platform without distribution is invisible, and invisible contradicts L2 (visibility).

## Fix = Deploy

On live apps: a fix is NOT done until it's deployed AND verified. Non-negotiable.

## Scoring V2

Session score measures three dimensions, not just process compliance.

### Dimensions

| Dimension | Weight | What it measures |
|-----------|--------|-----------------|
| **Value** | 40% | Did the session produce something deployable, publishable, or usable by Jay? |
| **Reliability** | 30% | How clean was execution? Rework count, regressions introduced, corrections needed. |
| **Process** | 30% | Were the methodology gates respected? (Obsidian, TDG, atomic commits, reformulation) |

### Value Scale (0-100)

| Score | Criteria |
|-------|----------|
| 90-100 | Shipped feature, deployed fix, published content, or completed significant design |
| 70-89 | Meaningful progress toward a deliverable (e.g., half a feature, research complete) |
| 50-69 | Foundational work (setup, scaffolding, propagation, methodology improvement) |
| 30-49 | Partial progress with blockers or scope reduction |
| 0-29 | Session produced no tangible output (stuck, circular, or meta-only) |

### Reliability Scale (0-100)

| Score | Criteria |
|-------|----------|
| 90-100 | Zero rework, zero regressions, all changes correct on first pass |
| 70-89 | Minor corrections needed (1-2), no regressions |
| 50-69 | Multiple corrections (3+) or 1 regression fixed in-session |
| 30-49 | Significant rework or regression that escaped the session |
| 0-29 | Circular failures, repeated same mistake, or data loss |

### Process Scale (0-100)

| Score | Criteria |
|-------|----------|
| 100 | All gates passed, zero violations, zero warnings |
| Per violation | -10 (Obsidian skip, TDG skip, no reformulation on >2 files) |
| Per warning | -2 (minor process deviation) |

### Final Score

`Score = (Value × 0.4) + (Reliability × 0.3) + (Process × 0.3)`

A session with perfect process (100) but no value (30) scores: 30×0.4 + 100×0.3 + 100×0.3 = **72**. Process alone is not enough.

A session with high value (95) and minor process issues (80) scores: 95×0.4 + 90×0.3 + 80×0.3 = **89**. Value matters most.

### In Session Reports

Report all three dimensions separately, then the weighted total:

```
| Dimension | Score | Notes |
|-----------|-------|-------|
| Value | 85 | Feature X deployed and verified |
| Reliability | 95 | 1 minor correction, zero regressions |
| Process | 100 | All gates passed |
| **Total** | **92** | |
```
